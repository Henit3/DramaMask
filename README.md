# Drama Mask

Adds a new type of mask, Drama, which is not haunted unlike its Tragedy and Comedy counterparts.
Wearing it will make other Masked enemies ignore you.

To balance this mechanic out, there is a stealth meter that is used while attempting to hide.

### Config Options
* All masks can be used by the player to hide
* The player can hide from all enemies [Experimental]
* Disable the stealth meter balancing mechanic
* Adjust stealth meter behaviour
* Adjust stealth meter appearance
* Show only mask outlines when wearing them
* Allow masks to be attached to players
* Allow attached masks to have their eyes activated

### Roadmap (dependent on feedback)
* Improve local mask attached view (separate from what others see)
* Differentiate configs when attached as opposed to just held up
	* Stealth usage
	* Mask appearance
* Add translucent mask view to bridge gap between default mask and the outline view
* Add fake Comedy/Tragedy masks to further confuse your friends
* Sync selected configs with the host
* Add better support for all the experimentatal all enemy hiding behaviour
* Allow the player to have their hands out like the Masked (unlikely without more help)

# Stealthy Masks

Wearing masks makes you blend in with the other Masked!
Also adds a new type of mask, Drama, which is not haunted unlike its Tragedy and Comedy counterparts, allowing you to use this feature safely!

They can also be attached to players' faces, allowing you to look identical to Masked enemies and spook your friends!
To balance this mechanic out, there is a stealth meter that is used while attempting to hide.

Due to the current transitioning of mod libraries from v49 to v50, LethalLevelLoader may be broken until v50 comes out.
This is only the case if you have both LLL and LLLFixed enabled; disabling LLL should fix this issue.
Works on v45-v50 with no other known incompatibilities; supports controller and LethalCompanyVR!

> Formerly known as DramaMask
